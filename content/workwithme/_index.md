      title: Recruiting PhD and/or MSc student
      text: |-
        > We are recruiting a fully funded PhD or MSc student for a project that bridges cutting edge environmental modeling, environmental valuation, remote sensing, and internationally relevant policy. Economic activity relies on clean air, water, a stable climate, and numerous natural resources, yet this support is often overlooked in decision-making, leading to suboptimal provision of public goods like flood regulation, habitat provision, and climate regulation. The student’s work will help inform methods used within Statistics Canada’s Census of Environment program, Canada’s implementation of the United Nations’ System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) framework.
        
        We seek a student start the Fall 2026 to work on these challenges by developing innovative methods to model and measure the value of natural capital and ecosystems to urban residents in Canada.
