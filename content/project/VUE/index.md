title: 'VUE: Valuing Urban Ecosystems'
summary: "Valuing Urban Ecosystems (VUE) is a project in partnership with Statistics Canada’s Census of Environment (CoE) team, the USGS, University of Waterloo, and Concordia University. The program works with the CoE to develop methods and applications to measure the value of natural capital to urban Canadians. VUE aims to focus on five critical ecosystem services that support urban well-being: water supply, flood regulation, urban recreation, local and global climate regulation (tree cooling and carbon sequestration). Following the United Nations' System of Environmental-Economic Accounting, VUE will help governments assess the impact of environmental change on society."
