Our group investigates how people meet their needs through use of ecosystems and natural resources, and how policy and land rights mediate this relationship. The group is led by Brian E Robinson, an associate professor in the [Department of Geography](https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/) at McGill University, and a member of the [Bieler School on the Environment](https://www.mcgill.ca/environment/). Our research methods draw from environmental and development economics, ecology, development geography, and geographic information sciences to answer policy-relevant questions.
